## Development

```js
yarn        // or npm install (download and install dependencies)
yarn start  // or npm start (Runs unit-test and code coverage)
yarn build  // or npm run build (Builds distribution file)
```
Source files are located at **/src/main** folder.

Unit test files are located at **/src/test** folder.

## Code Coverage

Both above scripts "_start_ and _test_" will generate the Code coverage report and will show instantly on the console a percentage summary of code-coverage.

Additionaly will be generated a **/coverage** folder with HTML, LCOV extra formats.

You can open /coverage/report-html into browser to have a detailed view file by file.
